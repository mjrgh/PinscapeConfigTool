<p>
In some cases, you might want a button or switch to send a
keystroke to the PC every time the switch state <b>changes</b>,
rather than when the button is held down or the switch is left on.
This is called Pulse Mode.
</p>

<p>
If you set a button to Pulse Mode, the controller will send <b>one key
press</b> to the PC when you push the button, and will then send
another single key press when you release the button.  It doesn't
matter how long you hold the button down: there will always be
exactly two key presses sent to the PC each time you push the
button, one when pressed, the second when released.
</p>

<p>
In contrast, a regular non-pulse mode button tells the PC it's
being held down continuously as long as the button is pressed. For a
keyboard key, this usually means Windows auto-repeats the key as long
as the button is held down.
</p>

<p>
The canonical example of a Pulse Mode button is the coin door
switch.  The VPinMAME software uses a "toggle" key for the coin
door.  One press of the key "opens" the virtual coin door in the
software, and a second press "closes" it.  This convention works
great for keyboard play, but it's really inconvenient for
cabinet use, where you want to connect your real coin door to
the software so that the pinball ROM knows when the door is open.
For a real coin door, it's much easier to install a physical
switch that senses the <b>state</b> of the coin door.  That is,
the switch is off when the coin door is closed, and on when
the door is open.  But that doesn't work well with VPinMAME's
expectation of one keystroke on opening the door, and a second
keystroke on closing the door.
</p>

<p>
The Pulse Mode option is designed to bridge this gap.  It lets
you install the physical switch the simple way, and translates
this to VPinMAME's "toggle key" convention by reporting
<b>changes</b> in the switch state to the PC.
When you open the physical coin door, the physical switch turns on,
so the Pulse Mode button sends a single keystroke to the PC.
VPinMAME reads the key and toggles the virtual coin door to "open".
As long as the coin door stays open, nothing more happens.  When
you close the coin door, the physical switch turns off, so the
Pulse Mode button sends another single keystroke to the PC.
VPinMAME reads this new key and toggles the virtual coin door
to "closed".  
</p>

<p>
You can select Pulse Mode for any key by clicking the pulse
mode icon <img src="PulseOn.png" style="vertical-align: middle;">
in the key's Options column.
</p>

<p>
The pulse mode setting applies to both the regular and shifted
meaning of the key.  There's no way to apply pulse mode only to
one or the other.
