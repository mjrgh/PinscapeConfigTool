<div>
   You can designate one cabinet button as the <b>local Shift button</b>.
   This isn't related to your PC keyboard - it's not <i>that</i>
   Shift key.  But it's a similar concept: it lets you give every
   physical button on your cabinet a second key assignment that
   you select by holding down the local Shift button and pressing
   the other button.
</div>

<div>
   This is great if you want to minimize the button clutter on
   your cabinet, since it lets you double the number of PC commands
   you can access with your existing buttons.
</div>

<div>
   To set up a Shift button, enter the button number that you
   want to use as the Shift, or just click on the shift icon
   (<img src="ShiftButtonHere.png" style="vertical-align:middle;">)
   in the button's row in the table.
</div>

<div>
   Once a shift button is assigned, every button in the table
   will let you enter two key assignments:  a regular key assignment
   and a shifted key assignment.  The regular key is sent to the PC
   when you press the button <i>without</i> pressing the Shift button.
   The shifted key is sent when you press the button while holding
   down the Shift button.
</div>

<h2>Mode options</h2>

<div>
   The Shift button itself can have a regular key assignment, just
   like any other button.  (It can't have a
   shifted key assignment, for obvious reasons.)
</div>
<div>
   The handling of the Shift button's key assignment is a little
   tricky.  It involves some trade-offs, so the controller lets you
   decide which way you want to handle it with the <b>Shift button
   mode</b> setting.
</div>
<div>
   <b>Shift OR Key mode:</b>  This is the default.  In this mode, the
   Shift button serves only <b>one</b> of its two functions on each
   press: it's <b>either</b> the Shift button, <b>or</b> it's an
   ordinary button with a key assignment.  Which one it is depends
   entirely on whether or not you press another key while the Shift
   button is pressed.
</div>
<div>
   To make this work, the Shift button can't send its assigned key
   assigned key to the PC immediately when you press it, the way a
   normal button would.  Instead, it has to wait to see if you're
   going to press another key while the Shift button is down.
   Here's how it decides what to do next:

   <ul>
	  <li>If you press the Shift button, and then release it without
	  pressing any other buttons in the meantime, the controller assumes
	  you were using the Shift button for its ordinary key assignment
	  rather than its Shift function.  In this case, the Shift button
	  sends its assigned key to the PC <i>when you release it</i>.
	  It has to wait until then, because that's the only way it knows
	  you're not going to press another button too.

	  <li>On the other hand, if you do press another button while 
	  the Shift button is down, the controller decides that you pressed
	  the Shift button for its Shift function.  In this case, it
	  <b>doesn't</b> send the Shift button's key to the PC for
	  this press, even when you release the button.
   </ul>

   This mode is the default because it lets you safely use any button
   as the Shift button without any unwanted side effects.  For example,
   suppose you assigned the "Exit" button as the Shift button.
   Normally, pressing this button terminates the current pinball
   table and returns to the selection menu.  When you use Exit as a Shift,
   though, you probably don't want that to happen.  It would be annoying
   if you just wanted to adjust the audio volume, say, and it also exited
   the game.  The "Shift OR Key" mode avoids unwanted side effects like
   this by skipping the regular key mapping every time the Shift function
   is used.  The tradeoff is that the normal key press is delayed until
   you release the button.
</div>
<div>
   <b>Shift AND Key mode:</b>  In this mode, the button sends its
   ordinary key mapping on every press, <i>in addition to</i> its
   Shift function.  Since the key is always sent, there's no need
   in this mode to wait to see if you're going to press another button.
   This lets the controller send the mapped key immediately when
   you press the button, just like for any other button.
</div>
<div>
   This mode eliminates the delay in sending the key that you get
   in the "Shift OR Key" mode - the way the key isn't sent until
   you <i>release</i> the button rather than when you first press
   the button.  Some people find that delay confusing or just annoying.
   If you don't like the delay, this mode lets you get rid of it.
</div>
<div>
   The tradeoff is that the button can't be "smart" about whether
   or not to send its mapped key on each press.  It just sends it
   every time.  So if you use this mode, just be careful to select 
   a button that won't have unwanted side effects when it sends
   its mapped key.
