<h1>
   IR Setup
</h1>

<div>
   The Pinscape unit can send and receive IR commands if you have the
   necessary extra components attached.  To send commands, you need an
   IR LED; to receive, you need an IR sensor (TSOP38438 or equivalent).
   The transmit and receive capabilities are independent, so you can
   attach either or both components.  The Build Guide has details on
   what you need and how to attach everything to the KL25Z.
</div>

<h2>IR Command List</h2>

<div>
   You can program the Pinscape device with a list of IR commands
   learned from the remote controls for your TV(s) and other devices.
</div>
<div>
   An IR "command" is the signal sent when you push a button on one
   of your remotes.  Each button generally has a unique IR signal
   associated with it.  Pinscape can learn these signals and store
   them in the command list, and then use the stored commands to
   repeat the same commands via its IR transmitter, and to recognize
   the commands when they come in on its receiver.
</div>
<div>
   Each entry in the IR Command List has the following elements:

   <ul>
	  <li>IR Code: this is a magic number representing a particular
	  IR command.  In most cases, you'll want to obtain these codes
	  using the "learn" function.

	  <li>Learn (<img src="irLearn.png" style="vertical-align:middle;">):
	  Click this button to bring up the "learn" dialog, which lets
	  Pinscape learn a code by reading the IR signal from one of
	  your remotes through the Pinscape IR receiver.

	  <li>Test (<img src="irTestButton.png" style="vertical-align:middle;">):
	  Click this button to test a code by transmitting it through the
	  Pinscape IR LED.  This lets you confirm that the target device
	  gets the signal when Pinscape sends the code.

	  <li>TV ON (<img src="TvOnButton.png" style="vertical-align:middle;">):
	  Click this to include the IR command in the TV ON sequence when
	  the system powers up.  This lets you turn on your cabinet TV(s)
	  with IR commands.

	  <li>Key (<img src="unusedButton.png" style="vertical-align:middle;">):
	  Click this to select a keyboard key or joystick button to send
	  to the PC whenever Pinscape receives the IR code.  This lets you
	  use a remote control to send key presses to the PC.

	  <li>Description: You can fill this in with the name of the remote
	  control button programmed into the slot ("Vizio TV ON", say).
	  This is purely optional.  It's just a memory jogger to help you
	  keep track of what's programmed where, since the "IR Code" field
	  is pretty cryptic by itself.
   </ul>

<h2>IR Code Numbers</h2>

<div>
   Each IR Code is a magic number that tells the Pinscape firmware how
   to read and send a particular remote control code.  It's "magic" in
   that it's really only meaningful within the Pinscape software.  The
   number encodes the type of infrared signal protocol the remote uses
   (these vary by manufacturer, and there are many) and the data bits
   contained in the IR signal.
</div>
<div>
   The best way to determine a code is to use the "learn" function,
   which lets Pinscape determine the code for a particular remote button
   by reading the signal that your remote sends when you press the
   button.  You can also simply type in a code if you happen to know the
   number, such as by getting a code from another Pinscape user.
   But you can't generally use code numbers you might see published in
   third-party IR code tables on the Internet, since every table uses its
   own numbering system that probably doesn't match the Pincsape format.
</div>
   

<h2>Things Pinscape can do with IR</h2>
<div>
   You can use the IR capabilities in several ways:

   <ul>
	  <li>Turn on your cabinet TV(s) when the system starts up
	  <li>Send key presses to the PC on receiving an IR command
	  <li>Transmit IR commands when you push a cabinet button
   </ul>

   These are all described in more detail below.
</div>

<h2>TV ON with IR</h2>

<div>
   The IR transmitter can be used to turn on your cabinet TVs when
   the system starts up.  This is a less invasive alternative to the
   hard-wired TV ON feature (where you have to open the TV's case
   and solder wires to your TV's "on" switch).  With IR, you don't
   have to do any surgery on the TV.
</div>

<div>
   If you haven't already configured the basic TV ON settings, you'll
   have to set that up first.  Go to the TV ON section in the
   settings, enable it, set the delay timer, and set up the input pins.
   If you're not using the Pinscape expansion boards, you'll need to
   build some external circuitry, which is explained in the Build
   Guide.  The "Power status input" and "Status latch output" parts
   are required.  The "Relay output" isn't required if you're only
   using IR (but it's also okay to use both IR and the relay; they're
   happy to work together or separately).
</div>

<div>
   Next, set up the Pinscape IR transmitter LED and position it so
   that your TV can see the commands it emits.  See the Build Guide
   for instructions on wiring the IR LED.  Position the LED so that
   it's near to and pointing at the remote control sensor window on
   the TV.
</div>

<div>
   All that remains is to program the TV's "ON" command into a slot in
   the IR code list.  Get out your TV's remote, and program the ON button
   into a slot as described above.  Click the TV ON icon
   (<img src="tvOnButton.png" style="vertical-align:middle;">)
   to include the command in the power-up sequence.  Pinscape will
   now transmit this command through its IR transmitter when the
   power comes on, after the delay timer finishes.
</div>

<h2>Send a key press on receiving an IR command</h2>

<div>
   You can program the Pinscape unit to send a key press to the PC on
   receiving an IR command.
</div>
<div>
   For example, suppose you want to be able to adjust the audio volume
   on your PC, but you don't have any spare buttons on your cabinet.
   And suppose you have an old remote control lying around for something
   you're no longer using, and it has some kind of Up and Down keys.
   You can program Pinscape so that it sends a keyboard "Volume Up" key
   to the PC when you press the Up button on the remote, and a keyboard
   "Volume Down" when you press Down on the remote.
</div>
<div>
   To use this feature, you'll need to set up the Pinscape IR sensor,
   and position it so that it can see IR light from your remote.  This
   means positioning the sensor outside the cabinet, or through a hole
   in the cabinet.  You can't place it entirely inside the cabinet, since
   IR light from the remote won't penetrate the cabinet walls.
</div>
<div>
   Now go to the IR Command List in the settings.  Program in the
   remote control button codes, as described above, for the buttons
   that you want to turn into keystrokes.  For each one, click the
   "Key" icon (<img src="unusedButton.png" style="vertical-align:middle;">)
   to select the key to send.  Once that's all set up, Pinscape will
   "press" the programmed key whenever it receives the corresponding
   IR command.
</div>

<h2>Send an IR command when you press a cabinet button</h2>

<div>
   You can program Pinscape to transmit an IR command whenever
   you press a cabinet button.
</div>
<div>
   For example, suppose that you want to be able to adjust your TV's
   volume via cabinet buttons.  To do this, you can configure buttons
   on your cabinet to send Volume Up and Volume Down commands
   to the TV via IR.
</div>
<div>
   To make this work, you need to set up the Pinscape IR transmitter LED,
   as explained in the Build Guide, and position the LED so that the
   TV's remote control sensor can see it.  This is the same arrangement
   needed for the TV ON feature via IR, so you probably already
   set that up.
</div>
<div>
   Now you just need to assign an IR command to each button that you want
   to use to send IR signals to the TV.  The first step is to program the
   IR command codes that you want to send.  Program the desired commands
   into slots in the IR command list as described above.
</div>
<div>
   Once you have the IR commands programmed, go to the Buttons section in
   the settings.  Find the row for the button that you want to use to send
   an IR command, and click the IR Command icon in the row
   (<img src="irButton.png" style="vertical-align:middle;">).  Select
   the desired IR command from the menu.
</div>
