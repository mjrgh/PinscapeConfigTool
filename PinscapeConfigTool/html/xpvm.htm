   Setting up a new board with Windows 8 or later
</h1>

<div>

   <p>
      Yes, I know how crazy it is that you have to find an old
      Windows machine to update a brand new KL25Z.  Unfortunately, the
	  factory firmware installed on new KL25Z boards was written when
	  Windows 7 was current, and Microsoft made changes in Windows 8
	  that are incompatible with that old firmware.
   </p>

   <p>
	  <b>Once you complete the upgrade, the KL25Z will work with
	  Windows 8 and later.</b>  But it's a catch-22, because you can't
      perform the upgrade that makes it work with Windows 8 or 10 from
	  Windows 8 or 10!
   </p>

   <p>
	  The easiest way to deal with this is to find an old machine
	  running Windows 7 or XP.  But if there's no way you can do that,
	  there are two solutions.  Both require some extra work,
	  but they'll let you do the upgrade with your existing machine.
   </p>

   <h2>Option 1: Tweak your Win 8/10 system</h2>

   <p>
	  The firmware incompatibility in Windows 8+ is related to the
	  disk search features that Microsoft added in Windows 8.
	  When you plug in a USB disk, Windows automatically writes to the
	  disk to create a hidden search index file.  The older KL25Z
	  boot loader mistakes this for an attempt to install new firmware
	  onto the device.  But since the index file isn't a valid firmware
	  file, the boot loader rejects it, which puts it in an error mode
	  where it refuses to accept any more requests.  This blocks any
	  subsequent attempts to download legitimate firmware files.
   </p>

   <p>
	  One way to solve this is to disable the Windows search indexing
	  service that causes the trouble.  This requires messing around
	  with your Windows system settings, so if RegEdit makes you queasy,
	  you might want to skip this approach and try a different option.
   </p>

   <p>
	  This method was first described (as far as I know) by
	  Erich Styger on his <a target="_blank" href="https://mcuoneclipse.com/2016/08/01/bricking_and_recovering_opensda_boards_in_windows_8_and_10/">MCU on Eclipse blog</a>.
	  Please see that article for a more thorough explanation.
   </p>

   <p>Here are the steps:</p>

   <ul>
	  <li>Disable removable devices for Windows library search:
	  <ul>
		 <li>If you have a "Professional" version of Windows:
		 <ul>
			<li>Press Windows+R
			<li>Type gpedit.msc into the box and press return
			<li>Navigate to Computer Configuration &gt; Administrative Templates &gt;
			Windows Components &gt; Search &gt; Do not allow locations on removable drives to be added to libraries
			<li>Enable the setting (which, in standard Microsoft fashion, disables the feature)
		 </ul>

		 <li>If you have a "Home" version of Windows:
		 <ul>
			<li>Press Windows+S
			<li>Type regedit into the search box - <b>don't</b> press return
			<li>A match for <b>regedit</b> should appear; right-click it and select <b>Run as Administrator</b>
			<li>Navigate to HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Search
			<li>Set the item DisableRemovableDriveIndexing to value 1
		 </ul>
	  </ul>

	  <li>Disable search services:
	  <ul>
		 <li>Press Windows+S
		 <li>Type services into the box
		 <li>Select "View local services"
		 <li>Find "Storage Service" in the list; right-click it and select Stop
		 <li>Find "Windows Search" in the list; right-click it and select Stop
	  </ul>
   </ul>

   <p>
	  Now you're ready to attempt the firmware upgrade on the KL25Z.
	  Be warned, though: you have to do the file copy <b>as quickly as possible</b>
	  after plugging in the KL25Z.  Apparently, the steps above prevent
	  Windows from writing the drive right after you plug it in, but Windows
	  might still try to do a write if you leave the drive plugged in long
	  enough.  So you should try to move quickly.
   </p>

   <p>
	  Other than this race against time, the upgrade itself works just like
	  in the main instructions.

   <ul>
	  <li>Hold down the Reset button on the KL25Z and plug in the programming port
	  <li>Release the Reset button
	  <li>Drag and drop the firmware upgrade onto the KL25Z
	  <li>As soon as the copy process finishes, unplug the USB
   </ul>

   <p>You can now verify the upgrade.  Plug the programming port back in (without
	  pressing the Reset button).   The KL25Z thumb drive should appear.  Open the
	  file SDA_INFO.HTM.  Check that the reported firmware version matches what you
	  just downloaded.
   </p>

   <h2>Option 2: Run XP or Win 7 in a virtual machine</h2>

   <p>
	  If you don't want to make the changes to your system settings
	  described above, or you can't get that approach to work, you can
	  solve the upgrade problem by running a <b>virtual</b> copy of
	  XP or Windows 7 on your existing operating system.  This approach
	  is fairly complicated, but it doesn't require any changes to your
	  system settings and doesn't require any special timing.
   </p>

   <p>
      The first thing you should do is <b>print out the instructions</b>
      that the Pinscape config tool displays for doing the firmware update.
      The config tool won't run on XP.  That's okay, because the config
      tool doesn't really do anything during the update process anyway
      except display the instructions.  But you can't run it to view the
      instructions in XP, so you'll want to have a copy handy before you
      start.  To do this, go to the "Set up a new KL25Z" page, click
      past the warning about Windows versions, then click "Show All".
      You can now print the page (there's a button at the bottom
      to do this).  If you have a two-monitor setup, no need to print;
      just leave the instructions on one screen while you run the XP VM
      on the other screen.
   </p>

   <p>
      The next step is to download and install <b>VirtualBox</b>, which
      is a free Virtual Machine manager.  Start here:
      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.virtualbox.org">virtualbox.org<a>.
      Download the latest version and go through the setup procedure to
      install the product on your computer.
   </p>

   <p>
      Now we get to the really time-consuming and difficult part.  You
      need to create an XP or Win 7 VM for VirtualBox.  There are
      basically two options for doing this:
   </p>

   <ul>

      <li><b>With an XP or Win7 install CD:</b>  If you have an old copy
      of XP or 7 on CD, you can use it to install that operating system
      on a new virtual machine.  To do this, run VirtualBox and click
      the "New" button on the toolbar.  Follow the steps to create
      a new VM, selecting the appropriate OS type (XP or 7) from the list
      when asked.  When you start the  machine, you'll be asked to
      insert your Windows boot CD into the CD.  The virtual machine
      will then go through the normal Windows installation procedure.
      It works just like installing Windows on real hardware, and it's
      just as lengthy and tedious.

      <li><b>With a pre-built image:</b>  Microsoft currently provides
      pre-built images of Windows 7 that are designed to allow Web
      developers to test against old versions of IE.  The URL for this
      seems to move around frequently, so I'm going to have you do a Web
      search: "free virtual machines from microsoft".  Look for a
      microsoft.com link in the results - anything else is likely to be
      either a warez site or a third-party tutorial site with a broken
      older link (like I said, Microsoft keeps moving the URLs around).
      The Microsoft page we're looking for is actually a tool for Web
      developers who want to test their sites against old IE versions.
      To make this easier for Web developers, Microsoft provides pre-built
      virtual machines with the old IE versions all set up.  But they'll
      work for our purposes equally well.  You'll be asked to select
      which one you want to download, by selecting an IE version, a
      Windows version, and a "platform".  Select <b>Windows 7</b> or
      earlier for the Windows version.  The IE version doesn't matter.
      Select <b>VirtualBox</b> for the platform.  Once you make your
      selections, the  page should offer you a file to download and
      installation instructions.  Downlaod the file, and read and follow
      the instructions.  You should have a working Windows 7 VM running
      in VirtualBox when you're done.

   </ul>

   <p>
      Once you have your XP/7 virtual machine running, shut it down
      by going to the Start menu within the virtual OS window and
      clicking Turn Off Computer.  Wait for the VM to shut down.
      The VM window will close when it's done.
   </p>

   <p>
      Now go back to the VirtualBox VM manager window.  Right-click
      the VM in the list and select Settings.  In the Settings window,
      select the USB page.  There should be a checkbox at the top labeled
      "Enable USB Controller".  Make sure it's checked.
   </p>

   <p>
      Plug in the KL25Z via the <b>programming</b> port.  Click the
      "+" button next to the "USB Device Filters" list.  You should
      see an entry in the pop-up list starting with "PE Microcomputer Systems Inc".
      That's the KL25Z programming port.  Click it to add it to the
      list.  Click OK.
   </p>

   <p>
      Unplug the KL25Z.
   </p>

   <p>
      Launch the VM by double-clicking it.  Wait for it to finish
      booting.  The XP/Win 7 desktop window should be showing and
      the disk should be done grinding away at startup tasks.
      Now plug in the KL25Z.  If all went well, it should appear
      on the XP/7 desktop and <b>not</b> on your real Windows
      desktop.
   </p>

   <p>
      Now get out that printout we made back at the beginning of
      this whole mess!  Follow the instructions to download and
      install the first .SDA file <b>within the XP/7 box</b>.
   </p>

   <p>
      At this point in the printed instructions, you'll be asked to
      unplug and re-plug the KL25Z.  Things get a little hazy here.
      You <i>might</i> need to add a new VirtualBox USB filter.
      Try re-plugging the KL25Z and see which desktop it connects
      to.  If it connects to the XP/7 desktop, all is good.  If
      it connects to your regular Windows desktop, go to the
      USB device menu in the VirtualBox controls, find the
      un-checked "PE Microcomputer Systems" item, and check it.
      After you check it, unplug the KL25Z and plug it back in.
      This time it will hopefully connect to the XP/7 desktop
      rather than your ordinary desktop.  If not, you might have
      to shut down the VM and repeat the USB Filter process we
      did earlier from the VirtualBox Settings dialog.
   </p>

   <p>
      Once you get through the whole procedure within the XP/7
      VM, disconnect the KL25Z and shut down the VM (Use "Turn off
      computer" from the Start menu within the VM window, and wait
      for the VM window to close).  Now plug the KL25Z back in,
      via the <b>programming</b> port.
   </p>

   <p>
      If all went well, you should have a drive on your Windows
      desktop labeled <b>FRDM-KL25Z</b>.  The drive label is very
      important.  If it's FRDM-KL25Z, everything worked and
      the device should be ready to use in your modern Windows
      version!  If the label <i>isn't</i> FRDM-KL25Z, something
      must have gone wrong somewhere along the way.  Try going
      back through the process above again.  If you can't get it
      to work after carefully repeating all the steps, post on
      vpforums.org and hopefully I or someone else will be able
      to help you troubleshoot.
