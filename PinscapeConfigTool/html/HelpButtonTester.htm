	  This window lets you test the physical button wiring on your
	  Pinscape unit.   
   </p>

   <p>	  
	  The list of buttons shows each assigned button and its GPIO
	  pin on the KL25Z, plus the on/off status of the pin.  If you've
	  wired the pin to a physical pushbutton, the pin status in the
	  button list will display ON when you push the button.  The pin
	  will also light up on the KL25Z diagram to help you trace wiring
	  if necessary.
   </p>

   <p>
	  If you need a reminder of the location of a button's assigned
	  pin on the KL25Z, mover the mouse over the button's list entry.
	  This will highlight the pin on the KL25Z diagram.  Alternatively,
	  moving the mouse over a pin on the KL25Z diagram will show
	  the pin name.
   </p>

   <p>
	  The pin status reflects the simple electrical status of the pin.
	  It simply shows whether or not the button is pushed.  None of the
	  extra processing, such as the Shift button or pulse timing, is
	  used for this display.  The intention is to let you see exactly
	  what's going on at the basic wiring level without confusing matters
	  with any of the software processing.
   </p>

   <p>
	  The keyboard and joystick button displays let you test the buttons'
	  key assignments.  These areas show the key presses being sent to the PC
	  via the Pinscape unit's keyboard and joystick device interfaces.
	  Unlike the physical pin status display, the keyboard and joystick displays
	  show the "logical" status of the keys, so they're affected by the pulse
	  timer on a "pulsed" button and by the "Shift" button, if you've assigned
	  one.
   </p>

   <p>
	  Note that the keyboard diagram can't differentiate between keys coming
	  from the Pinscape unit and those coming from your regular keyboard,
	  so any keys you press on your keyboard will appear on the diagram.  In
	  contrast, the joystick button status area only shows the Pinscape
	  unit's joystick buttons.  It won't show buttons from any other
	  joysticks you might have attached to your system.  Likewise, the
	  physical pin status display isn't affected by keys pressed on
	  your keyboard or any other devices.
