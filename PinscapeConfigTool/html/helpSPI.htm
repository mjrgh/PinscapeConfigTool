   SPI GPIO Pins

   <p>
      If you're using TLC5940 chips with your controller setup, either with
      the official expansion boards or with your own custom circuitry, you'll
      need to attach a couple of the TLC5940 pins to special pins on the KL25Z
      that connect internally to an on-board subsystem called the
      SPI Controller.
   </p>

   <p>
      The pin selector on the configuration page automatically shows you
      the valid choices for each pin requiring an SPI function, so
      you just need to choose from the available pins.
   </p>

   <p>
      The reason that such a small number of pins is shown for each SPI
      connection is that these are the only pins the KL25Z hardware allows for
      these functions.  The KL25Z's internal wiring makes the 
      SPI Controller reachable only through a very limited set of pins.
   </p>

   <p>
      (You don't need to know the following details to set up your controller,
      but in case you're curious:  SPI stands for Serial Peripheral Interface,
      which is one of those electronics-industry standards, in this case for
      connecting different digital devices together for communications and control
      functions.  The TLC5940's control interface is compatible with SPI, and
      the KL25Z has a dedicated SPI hardware module, so it's a perfect match to
      connect the two devices using this module.  The big benefit of doing so
      is that the SPI module works autonomously, freeing up the KL25Z CPU
      to do other work while TLC5940 data transfers are taking place.
      Without the hardware helper, TLC5940 communications would
      impose a very high workload on the CPU, which would cut into our
      ability to perform other functions, such as monitoring the plunger
      sensor and sending joystick updates to the host PC.)
