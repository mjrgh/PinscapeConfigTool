   Output Port Options
</h1>

<div>
   The "option" icons next to each port let you select special handling for the port.
   In the Settings window, you can click on an option icon to toggle its status.  Note
   that some options are only available with certain types of ports, so you won't
   necessarily see all of the option icons listed next to every port.
</div>
<div>
   (In the Output Tester window, the icons are displayed, but can't be changed.
   Use the Settings window if you want to change any of the options for a port.)
</div>

<div>

   <h2><img src="NoisyOn.png"> Noisy Port</h2>

   <p>
      Set this option for ports that you're using to control noise-making devices,
	  such as solenoids and motors.
   </p>

   <p>
      Each port marked with this flag will be deactivated when Night Mode
      is engaged.  These ports will operate only in "Day Mode", 
	  when Night Mode is off.
   </p>

   <p>
      If you're using the Night mode feature, you should first go through your devices
      and figure out the port you're going to connect each device to.  Then,
      set the "Noisy" flag for each noise-making device.  When you turn on
      Night Mode, these devices will be disabled, allowing you to play more quietly.
   </p>

   <p>
      If you're not using the Night Mode feature, you can ignore this option.
   </p>

   <h2><img src="GammaOn.png"> Gamma</h2>

   <p>
      If this option is set, the controller applies "gamma correction" to the port.
      This adjusts the intensity level of the port on a curved scale so that it
      better matches the way the human eye perceives brightness.
   </p>

   <p>Gamma correction is best for ports connected to lighting devices like lamps
      and LEDs.  When used with lights, gamma correction makes "fading" effects look
      more linear to the eye, and improves RGB color mixing accuracy.  You generally
      shouldn't use gamma correction with other device types, such as solenoids
      and motors.
   </p>

   <p>
      The gamma correction option is only available for ports with PWM capability,
      because it only affects intermediate intensity levels between fully off
      and fully on.  Gamma correction isn't an option on digital-only ports,
	  such as Digital GPIO ports, 74HC595 outputs, and chime board outputs,
	  since these ports can't vary their intensities.
   </p>

   <p>
      To keep things simple, the controller uses a fixed gamma of 2.8.
   </p>

   <h2><img src="ActiveLowOn.png"> Active Low</h2>

   <p>
      This option reverses the voltage levels for ON and OFF for a GPIO output port.
   </p>

   <p>
      By default, ports are "active high", meaning that the output controller
      sets the port's GPIO pin to "high" (3.3V) when the software port is ON,
      and sets it to "low" (0V) when the software port is OFF.
   </p>

   <p>
      Setting this option reverses those voltages.  An "active low" port's GPIO
      pin is "low" (0V) when the software port is ON, and "high" (3.3V) when
      the software port is OFF.
   </p>

   <p>
      <b>Don't</b> use this option with the MOSFET "booster circuit" described
      in the Build Guide.  That circuit is designed for the default Active High
      triggering.
   </p>

   <p>
      Do use this option if you're using some other type of booster circuit that
      requires active-low triggering.  This is fairly common among third-party
      "relay boards" designed for Arduino projects, for example.  If you have a
      relay board that instructs you to connect the control input to "Ground" or
      "GND" or 0V to trigger it, it's an active-low design and you should select
      this option.
   </p>

   <p>
      Note that this option only works with GPIO ports.  The Expansion Board
      ports and the external output chips (TLC5940 and 74HC595) have different
      designs that can't use this feature.  In the case of the expansion boards,
      it's moot anyway because those boards have their own booster circuits built in.
   </p>

   <h2><img src="FlipperLogicOn.png"> Flipper Logic</h2>

   <p>
      This option sets special timing and power properties for the port, to protect
      certain types of coils and solenoids from overheating.  When Flipper Logic
      is enabled on a port, the controller simulates the way a real pinball
      machine flipper coil works.  Whenever the PC software turns the port on,
      the controller gives the port full power briefly, then reduces power to a
      lower level.  The lower level is maintained as long as the PC software
      leaves the port on.  The point is to get the full mechanical effect from
      the device when it's first actuated, by giving it full power initially, but
      then protect the device from overheating by quickly reducing power to a
      sustainable level.
   </p>
   <p>
      This option is mutually exclusive with Chime Logic (see below).  Chime
      Logic will be automatically disabled if you enable Flipper Logic.
   </p>
   <p>
      There's no need to use this option with devices that are designed for
      long-term activation, such as contactors.  This option is designed
      for devices that would overheat if left on for long periods at
      full power.
   </p>
   <p>
      When you click the Flipper Logic icon, a popup box will appear to let
      you enter two additional parameters:
   </p>

   <ul>
      <li>Initial time:  the time limit for the initial burst of
      full power.  This can range from a minimum of 50ms (1/20 of a second)
      to 800ms (0.8 seconds), in 50ms increments.  Each time the PC software
      activates the port, the port gets 100% power until this time expires.
      (Of course, this is only a maximum, not a minimum: if the PC turns the
      port off in a shorter time, the port simply turns off immediately.)

      <li>Hold power: the reduced power level given to the port after the
      initial time expires.  This is a percentage of full power, in
      approximately 7% increments.
      <p>
         The power reduction is accomplished using PWM (pulse width
         modulation), so you can only set a fractional power level for
         a port that's PWM-capable.  For a digital port, the hold power
         is fixed at 0% and can't be changed, since a digital port is
         incapable of power levels other than fully ON or fully OFF.
      </p>
   </ul>

   <p>
      The point of this feature is to expand your range of choices
      for devices to simulate flippers in your virtual cab.  Traditionally,
      cab builders have been limited to devices like contactors that are
      able to withstand long periods of activation.  The Flipper Logic
      option makes it feasible to use more types of devices, since
      it can greatly reduce the heat load on a device that's left on
      for a long period.
   </p>
   <p>
      The right settings depend on the individual device, so you'll have
      to experiment.  The goal is to find the minimum power setting where
      the device stays mechanically activated - that is, where the plunger
      or lever stays in the "on" position.  For most devices, you should
      be able to use the minimum full-power time of 50ms, so you should only
      have to find the right hold power level.  Start at the lowest hold
      power level.  Program the KL25Z with the new settings, then go to the
      output tester and activate the port.  If it stays mechanically activated
      for a few seconds, you've found the right hold power, so turn off the
      port and continue with the next step below.  If not, go back to the
      settings page and try the next higher hold power level, and repeat
      until you find a working level.
   </p>
   <p>
      There's one more step: you need to verify that the selected hold power
      setting is safe for the device.  Go to the output tester and turn
      on the port again.  Carefully monitor the device to make sure it
      doesn't get hot to the touch.  Warm is okay, but you should be able
      to touch it without getting burned.  If the device doesn't get hot
      after about two minutes, it should be fine indefinitely.  That's
      long enough for the device to reach thermal equilibrium, where
      it's shedding heat as fast as it's generating it, in which case
      it shouldn't overheat no matter how long you leave it on.
   </p>
   <p>
      If the device does start getting hot within the first couple
      of minutes, turn it off immediately to prevent damage.  The device
      probably isn't suitable for use as a flipper simulator in this case,
      even with the Flipper Logic option.
   </p>

   <p>
      <b>0% hold power:</b>
      If you set the hold power to 0%, the controller will simply turn the
      port off entirely after the initial time expires.  This simulates
      the Pinscape "chime board", which has hardware timers that turn off
      the ports if they're left on for more than a couple of seconds.
      This isn't suitable for flippers, since it would generate an "off"
      feedback effect prematurely, before the player releases the flipper
      buttons.  But it is perfectly fine for many other types of devices,
      especially replay knockers and chimes, since the software should
      never energize these devices for more than a split second in the
      first place.  It's probably also appropriate for devices simulating
      bumpers and slingshots.
   </p>
   <p>
      Note that the PC software can still control the intensity of the
      effect.  During the initial "full power" period, the controller
      will actually pass through whatever intensity level the PC software
      specifies.  DOF uses reduced power levels for software noises from
      solenoids in some cases, and this will still work properly with
      a Flipper Logic port, since the Pinscape unit will use the DOF
      intensity level during the initial "full power" period.  During
      the hold period, the PC can also vary the power, but only below
      the limit given by the hold power setting.  Any higher power
      that the PC tries to set during the hold period will be capped
      at the hold power.  It would be unusual for PC software to do
      this with a solenoid, since it wouldn't normally create any
      sort of noticeable effect, but the Pinscape software supports
      it just in case there's some need for it.
   </p>

   <h2><img src="ChimeLogicOn.png"> Chime Logic</h2>

   <p>
      This option lets you set minimum and maximum ON time intervals
      for the port.
   </p>
   <p>
      This option is mutually exclusive with Flipper Logic (see above).
      Flipper Logic will be automatically disabled if you enable Chime Logic.
   </p>
   <p>
      The Chime Logic options let you set fairly precise timing
      intervals, especially for very short intervals from single
      milliseconds to tens of milliseconds.  PC-side software isn't
      capable of the the same degree of timing precision that the
      controller can offer, since the PC software has to deal with
      several layers of Windows software and USB hardware that
      interpose a certain amount of fuzziness in the timing.
   </p>
   <p>
      Setting a minimum time can be useful for mechanical devices that
      require a certain minimum amount of time before their effects
      reach full strength.  For example, some contactors won't make a
      satisfying enough "clunk" sound unless they're activated for at
      least 10 or 20 milliseconds at a time.
   </p>
   <p>
      The maximum time can be useful for devices like chimes that depend
      on very rapid ON/OFF cycling.  It can also be used to protect
      coils against overheating, doing the same job in software that the
      Pinscape "Chime Boards" do in hardware via their time limiter circuits.
      The maximum time setting is similar to the Flipper Logic full power
      time, but it comes with a trade-off.  On the upside, it offers finer
      gradations of time at the short end of the scale, from single milliseconds
      to tens of milliseconds.  On the downside, Chime Logic can only turn
      off the port power entirely when the maximum is reached, whereas Flipper
      Logic can leave the port on at reduced power when used with a PWM port.
   </p>
   <p>
      To activate Chime Logic, click the chime icon next in the port row
      for the desired port.  When you click the icon, a popup box will appear
      to let you enter the minimum and maximum time values.  The minimum time
      can be set to a range of values from 0ms to 800ms.  The maximum time
      has a similar range of selections, and can also be set to "infinity"
      for no time limit at all.
   </p>
   <p>
      If you set a maximum time that's less than the minimum time, the minimum
      time takes precedence.  The effect therefore is that the port will always
      be on for exactly the minimum time.
   </p>
