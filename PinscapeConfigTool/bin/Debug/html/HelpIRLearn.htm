<h1>
   IR Learning mode
</h1>

<div>
   The Pinscape unit can learn remote control commands through
   its IR sensor.  To use this feature, you have to set up the
   IR receiver, as described in the Build Guide.
</div>

<div>
   After bringing up the IR learning dialog, get your remote
   control ready by pointing it at the Pinscape IR sensor.  Don't
   press any buttons on the remote yet.  Click the Learn button
   when you're ready.  When prompted, <b>press and hold</b> the
   remote control key you want Pinscape to learn.  The dialog
   window will update automatically as soon as Pinscape learns
   the code, which usually only takes a second or two.
</div>

<div>
   If the learning process fails, you can click "Try Again"
   to give it another go.  IR transmissions occasionally
   fail due to momentary problems, such as interference
   from another light source.  If Pinscape refuses to recognize
   the code after a couple of tries, though, the remote probably
   isn't compatible with the Pinscape hardware or software.
   There are two main possibilities:

   <ul>

	  <li>If the pulse display at the bottom of the dialog
	  shows a series of lines, the sensor is properly detecting
	  the physical IR signal from your remote, but the Pinscape
	  software doesn't recognize the data format.  There are
	  many IR data formats; the Pinscape software recognizes
	  about 30 of them, which cover most of the major consumer
	  electronics companies, but there are many other obscure
	  protocols that Pinscape doesn't recognize.  In this case,
	  there's hope: the problem is purely a matter of software,
	  so we might be able to add support for the new protocol
	  in a future version if you contact the Pinscape developers
	  and let us know about it.  Tell us the make and model of
	  the TV or other device, and include the contents of the
	  "Show Raw Data" window.

	  <li>If the pulse display at the bottom of the dialog is
	  completely blank, the sensor isn't receiving any signal
	  at all from the remote.  This might mean that your remote
	  is using an IR wavelength or modulation frequency that
	  the Pinscape sensor can't receive.  Unfortunately, this
	  type of incompatibility is difficult to solve, because
	  it would require replacing the sensor with one that can
	  work with your remote.  But replacing the sensor could
	  create a whole separate problem, in that the Pinscape
	  software is only designed to work with the recommended
	  sensor type.  Before giving up, you might want to
	  double-check that the sensor itself is working, by
	  trying a remote from different manufacturer.

   </ul>
