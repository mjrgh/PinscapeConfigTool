   <p>
	  This window lets you manually control the TV ON relay, to test
	  that the relay is working and that it's properly controlling
	  your TV.
   </p>

   <p>
	  Click the <b>Relay On</b> button to toggle the relay on and off.
	  Use this to confirm that the relay is operating correctly.  You
	  should be able to hear the relay click each time you toggle it.
   </p>

   <p>
	  You can also click the <b>Pulse</b> button to simulate the brief
	  on/off pulse that the firmware uses when you turn the system on.
	  This turns the relay on for about a quarter of a second and then
	  turns it back off.  You should be able to hear the relay click
	  on and then quickly off when you pulse it.
   </p>

   <p>
	  If you've wired your TV's on/off button to the relay, the TV
	  should switch on or off each time you pulse the relay, since
	  the TV should think you're pushing the button each time the
	  relay fires.
   </p>

   <p>
	  If you're using the expansion boards, note that the relay runs
	  on power from the secondary power supply (the one that's meant
	  to power your feedback devices, marked "PSU2" on the expansion
	  boards).  So the relay won't actually turn on if the PSU2
	  power is off.  It's designed that way out of a general preference
	  in the expansion board design for keeping everything mechanical
	  (like the relay) away from your primary PC power supply, since
	  mechanical things tend to generate electrical noise.
