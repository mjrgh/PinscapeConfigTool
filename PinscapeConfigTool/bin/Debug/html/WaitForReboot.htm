	 The device seems to be taking longer than expected to connect.

      <div>
	 <b>Note!</b>  If anything went wrong saving the new settings to Flash
	 on the KL25Z, the device might revert to the factory defaults.
	 If this happens, be aware that <b>your new settings were
	 automatically saved</b> to the <a href="#" id="showDocs">downloads folder</a>
         before the update.  You can restore that file settings using the
	 Backup &amp; Restore button on the main menu.
      </div>

      <script>
$("#showDocs").click(function(ev) {
    window.external.ShowDocsFolder();
    ev.preventDefault();
});

      <div>
	 Here are some things you can try to get the device back on-line:
      </div>

      <ul>
	 <li>Manually reset the KL25Z, by pressing the reset button
	 for a couple of seconds.

	 <li>
	 <img src="kl25z-reboot-diagram.png" style="float: right; margin-left: 2em;">
	 Power-cycle the KL25Z.  Unplug all USB cables (both
	 the programming port and joystick port cables).  Wait a few
	 seconds, then plug it back in via the joystick port
	 (as shown at right).

	 <li>If you have any other Pinscape Controller units attached,
	 unplug all of the others, in case there's a conflict between devices.

	 <li>If you have any real LedWiz units installed, try unplugging
	 them as well.

	 <li>The problem might be caused by device driver caching
	 inside Windows.  This is especially likely if you've just added
	 keyboard keys to the input button mappings for the first time,
	 because it changes the device from a pure joystick-type device
	 to a multi-interface device, which looks slightly different to
	 the Windows device manager.  You can fix this caching problem
	 by manually uninstalling the old device driver.  This makes
	 Windows forget the old settings, allowing it to establish the
	 correct new settings on the next connection attempt.
	 To do this, follow these steps:

	 <ul>
	    <li><b>Leave the device plugged in throughout this procedure.</b>
	    
	    <li>Open Windows Device Manager: Go to the Windows Start menu,
	    or bring up global search on Windows 8+ by pressing Start+S,
	    then type "Device Manager" into the search box.

	    <li>Find the device list section for "Human Interface Devices"
	    and open it.

	    <li>Look for a "USB Input Device" entry that's marked with a
	    "warning" or "trouble" icon.  If you don't see any marked items,
	    look at each "USB Input Device" item in turn.  For each item,
	    double-click it to open its Properties dialog, and go to the Events tab.
	    In the "Information" box, you should see a string like this:

	    <p><tt>Device USB\VID_FAFA&PID_00F7...</tt></p>

	    <p>The important part is the fragment reading <b>VID_FAFA</b> or <b>VID_1209</b>.
	    If you see one of these strings, this is probably the right device.</p>

	    <li>Once you've identified the problem item, close the properties
	    dialog, right-click the entry in the list, and select Uninstall.  This
	    is the key step that removes the old cached Windows device information.

	    <li>Check for any other items that match the same description.
	    There might be more than one.  Uninstall each one.

	    <li>Once you're satisfied that you've cleared out the problematic
	    device entries, close Device Manager.  Unplug the
	    KL25Z (both cables - programming and joystick), wait a few
	    moments, then plug it back in via the joystick cable.
	 </ul>

	 <li>As a last resort, try rebooting Windows.

	 <li>As a last resort after that, try reinstalling the Pinscape firmware
	 onto the KL25Z.  This will reset it to a "factory" configuration, which
	 might solve the problem if something got corrupted along the way.

      </ul>
